## Problem Statement 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Report Generation

This repository is a part of my MLOps practice exercises. The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a public dataset and generate a PDF report.

### Tasks
- Perform data cleaning and null value handling.
- Visualize distributions, correlations, and detect outliers.
- Generate insights from the data.
- Export the EDA notebook and PDF report.

### Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (from Kaggle).
- It includes information about passengers such as:
  - Age, Sex, Fare, Class, Embarkation port, Survival status, etc.
